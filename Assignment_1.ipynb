        " Conditional statements in Python are essential for controlling the flow of a program based on certain conditions. They allow you to execute specific blocks of code only when certain conditions are met, making your programs more dynamic and responsive. Here are the key purposes of conditional statements:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Decision Making: Conditional statements help in making decisions within a program. For example, you can use if, elif, and else statements to execute different code blocks based on different conditions.\n",

        "* Error Handling: Conditional statements can be used to handle errors and exceptions gracefully. By checking conditions before executing code, you can prevent runtime errors and provide meaningful error messages.\n",

        "* User Input Validation: They are useful for validating user inputs. You can check if the input meets certain criteria before processing it further, ensuring that your program behaves correctly.\n",
